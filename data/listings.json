With significant road frontage on a major state route, the property offers exceptional accessibility while maintaining the privacy and seclusion that serious land buyers demand. The acreage features mature timber stands with strong commercial value, rolling terrain ideal for wildlife management, and the size necessary for serious hunting operations. At 160 acres, the property provides sufficient scale for establishing food plots, creating sanctuary areas, and implementing comprehensive habitat improvements. The land's natural features support robust populations of whitetail deer, turkey, and small game. Beyond recreational use, this property offers flexibility for timber investment, potential development opportunities given its SR 26 frontage, or simply holding as a legacy asset. Properties of this size with paved road access are increasingly rare in Washington County, making this a noteworthy opportunity for investors, serious hunters, or those seeking a significant land holding in southeast Ohio.
